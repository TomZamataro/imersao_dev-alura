## Imers√£oDev | Alura

### Class - 10, Challange - 10

#### Proposed challange (chosen one):

Create a "Certificard" - without a given pen template - that will act like the certificate for the imersion, by demostrating what have I learned, the "Certificard" - pun intended I assume - should contain my photo, name, contact info - with links to them - and a field with the "Imersion Badges", that will be composed by a title, a link to the GitHub repository, a list with all the challanges and their "Badges", each with the link for the respective branch in the repo. and for the pen - in full view mode. The structure and style of the "Certificard" should all be done in HTML and CSS.

##### Post thought feature:

By the side of each contact option include a button that will copy the link, address or number to the user's clipbord.
